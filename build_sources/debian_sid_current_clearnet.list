## Using specific codenames (for example: "buster") rather than generic code
## names (for example: "stable") because grml-debootstrap did not support
## generic code names for --release. See also:
## github.com/grml/grml-debootstrap/issues/37

## Using contrib, because it contains virtualbox-guest-x11.

## Added deb-src so source package can also be downloaded.
